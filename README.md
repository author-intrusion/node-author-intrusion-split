# Author Intrusion (Node.js)

[Author Intrusion](https://authorintrusion.com/) is a set of tools and libraries used to create an IDE-like environment for writers. It is focused less on user-friendly UIs and more toward static configuration files, such as typically found in programming frameworks (such as `package.json` for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) packages).

This package, `node-author-intrusion-split`, is a plugin to split the content into various components, typically on words and punctuation. It also handles splitting into logical elements, such as paragraphs and sentences. Additional functional is included to identify the stems of the tokens, if available
the common types, interfaces, and logic for other Node.js packages.

For the core Author Intrusion functionality, see [node-author-intrusion-service](https://github.com/author-intrusion/node-author-intrusion-service) and [node-author-intrusion-cli](https://github.com/author-intrusion/node-author-intrusion-cli).
