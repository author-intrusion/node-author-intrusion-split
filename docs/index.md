# Author Intrusion for Node.js

[Author Intrusion](https://authorintrusion.com/) is a set of tools and libraries used to create an IDE-like environment for writers. It is focused less on user-friendly UIs and more toward static configuration files, such as typically found in programming frameworks (such as `package.json` for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) packages).
